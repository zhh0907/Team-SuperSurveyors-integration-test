## Describe
This part is the integration testing part. We facing a lot of question dealing with this part. To elaborate, this website using firebase as backend, which all of us are not really familiar with how to do integration testing with it local. We tried to do the mock to mock everything, however, we notice that if we are actually mocking the firebase, then there is no different between whitebox tesing and integration testing. So we tried to use the firebase emulator, but is really hard to use for us. We did figure out how to use it at the end but it does delay our schdule which causing that we only have one complete integration testhing in this part.
